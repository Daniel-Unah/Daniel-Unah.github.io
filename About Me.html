                    My name is Daniel Unah, and I am a Computer Science student at Washington University in St. Louis. I am originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and grew up with my mom, dad, older brother, and younger sister. 
                    I have been interested in technology for as long as I can remember, and I plan on pursuing a career in Software Engineering or Data Science. I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL, React, MongoDB, C++, Python, R, and Java through
                    university coursework and independent exploration. I have experience as a Data Analyst Intern at TKC Holdings and a Software Engineer Intern at General Motors. Some of my favorite things to do for fun are play and watch sports, my favorites being
                    soccer and basketball, watch anime, listen to music, read books, and exercise.
