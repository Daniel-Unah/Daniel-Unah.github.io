        My name is Daniel Unah, and I am a computer science student at Washington University of St. Louis. I am originally from Durham, North Carolina, and grew up with my mom, dad, older brother, and younger sister. 
        I have been interested in technology for as long as I can remember, and I plan on pursuing a career in software engineering or data science. I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, mySQL, Python, R, and Java through
        university coursework and independent exploration. I have experience as a Data Analyst intern at TKC Holdings, and I will be interning as a Digital and Information Tecnhology Intern at General Motors in the Summer of 2024.
