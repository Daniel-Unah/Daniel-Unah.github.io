      <h3>Links to some of my projects:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm a big basketball fan, and my favorite player since I was 10 has been LeBron James. I built a LeBron stat tracking dashboard, that I called Goat Tracker, using React.js with a Python Flask backend, that pulls data from this <a href="https://github.com/swar/nba_api">API</a>, and deployed it using Railway. You can check it out here: <a href="https://goat-tracker-production.up.railway.app/">Link</a></li>
        <li>I've been a Chelsea fan since I was a kid, so I wanted to build a place where fellow Chelsea supporters could catch up on the latest news, fixtures, and squad info all in one spot. I made this site using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, and it pulls in real-time data from football and news APIsâ€”perfect for staying connected with the club and the community. It's a work in progress, but you can check it out here: <a href="https://chelsea-fan-app-production.up.railway.app/">Link</a></li>
        <li>My school WashU uses Workday to host our academic information, so I built this web app that accept's a student's schedule in the format of a spreadsheet, and provides them with links to easily add recurring events to their Google Calendar with all of the info. You can check it out here: <a href="https://workday-to-googlecal.vercel.app/">Link</a></li>
        <li>Weather app built using React.js and the OpenWeatherMap API: <a href="https://daniel-unah.github.io/weather-app/">Link</a></li>
        <li>Game of Nim app built using React.js and deployed with Vercel: <a href="https://game-of-nim.vercel.app/">Link</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Unity C# Video Game</h3>

      <div class="game-buttons">
        <button onclick="loadGame()">Play Game</button>
      </div>

      <p>Click the Play Game button to open the game up in a full screen window, and click the escape button to end the game. This is Wave Survival, a 2D wave-based survival game, inspired by Call of Duty Zombies I built for a Video Game Programming class at my school using Unity C#. In each wave, eliminate all enemies to open up the shop. Aim your weapon with the mouse and shoot by clicking, or enter the pause menu (escape key) and toggle auto-fire to have your player automatically shoot wherever you aim without any input. In between each wave, you can either buy a new weapon, upgrade your current weapons, or upgrade your health. Close the shop to start the next wave.
